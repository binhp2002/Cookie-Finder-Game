This is a game called cookie finder.
Use the return button on the title screen to game screen to play the game.
Use the delete button to return to the title screen at any time.
Use the up, down, left, right arrow keys to control the cookie when the game start.
Try to control the mouth and touch all the cookies on screen.
You win if you touch and eat all the cookie (score = 2)
If the mouth touch the cake, which isn't a cookie, you will automatically lose (since the game is called cookie finder and not cake finder)

Enjoy!
