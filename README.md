# Cookie-Finder-Game

• Developed an interactive graphical application in C and Makefile that runs on the GBA emulator where the player button input allows for in-game character 2D movement and objects collision to gain or lose points.

• Utilized concepts such as Dynamic Memory Allocation, videoBuffer, waitforVBlank,... to reduce tearing, colliding with objects on the screen, and help create a smooth and efficient application.

• Implemented nin10kit to design the layout, characters, and level for the game.
